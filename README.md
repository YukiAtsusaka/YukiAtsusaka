I am Assistant Professor in the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston. I research electoral systems, race and representation, and ranking data. 

This readme introduces several packages of mine under development. For more information on my research, please visit my [website](https://atsusaka.org/) or [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ypyoz5dw6izcm20iumsby/CV_YukiAtsusaka.pdf?rlkey=bs7lw1k1kmvvgz40uf066zden&st=kns2szyp&dl=0).
